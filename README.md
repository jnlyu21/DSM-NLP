This repository contains the code for the DSM volumes 1-5 NLP analysis.
The files entitled “dsm_disorder.py” are the scripts that are supposed to be run.

analyze_dsm_sect.py contains the bulk of the code used in the analysis, including topic modelling, creating a co-occurrence matrix and visualizing the co-occurrence matrix into a network graph.

dsm_sankey.py and dsm_wordcloud.py were the files used to create the sankey and wordcloud visualizations. 

The group’s writeup has also been included for an in-depth analysis of visualizations (screenshots included).


The PDF files used for each DSM volume can be found in the following GDrive link:
